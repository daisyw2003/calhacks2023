# Welcome to Our Custom Task Manager

While this is not a complete project is, please check out User Database to see how our tasks are managed.

## About Our Project

Oftentimes, it's a hassle to have to move between your calendar of events and filling out your availabilities in something like a When2Meet or a LettuceMeet. With our task manager, we're hoping to be able to combine the two into one webapp where you can put in all your tasks and time, and easily be able to look up your friends' availabilities!

### What We Have So Far

So far we have our database where you can add tasks and look up yours or someone else's tasks using their name and email. This is in Single User Entry and Lookup. Since as of now, it's for personal use, there are no passwords or such, but one could be implement if needed. You can also look up multiple people's tasks and times, however, you cannot add any one the Multi-User Lookup page.


### What's to be Done

1. We hope to include a visual where you can see the calendar blocks lined up side by side as well as make it color-customizable. This way it can be more visual and easier to understand.
2. We hope to include a feature that automatically produces all of the "free time" between two ore more people, aka when are both people available according to the task manager.
    
    a. Along with this we hope that one day we can incldue a geographical feature to recommend locations for these free blocks of time by either finding a close location based on the users' last location (so where they listed their location in their task before) or their 'Home' location.
